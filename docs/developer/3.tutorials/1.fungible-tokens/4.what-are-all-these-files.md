# What Are All These Files
In this chapter, let's talk about the file structure of a CosmWasm contract project.
```bash
aura-nft/ # Root
├── .cargo/ 
│   └── config # Configuration for cargo commands such as cargo wasm, cargo schema, etc.
├── examples/
│   └── schema.rs # Rust file to generate JSON schema via cargo schema. Outputs to schema/
├── schema # Output folder for JSON schema
├── src/ # Where our smart contract rust files are located
│   ├── contract.rs # Main contract logic, instantiate, execute, query
│   ├── error.rs # Where we define our contract errors
│   ├── lib.rs # The default library, where we define the modules
│   ├── msg.rs # Where we define our message types
│   └── state.rs # Where we define any state variables
├── Cargo.toml # The manifest, it contains all of the metadata that Cargo needs to compile source code
```

This covers most of the important directories that you will encounter. Others such as Cargo.toml are for your dependencies and others are simple .md files for reading.

<!-- ### Cargo.toml
The `Cargo.toml` is called a manifest, and it contains all of the metadata that Cargo needs to compile source code. It is written in the TOML format. Every manifest file consists of the following sections:
- `cargo-features` — Unstable, nightly-only features.
- `[package\]` — Defines a package.
- `Target tables`
- `Dependency tables`
- `[badges]` — Badges to display on a registry.
- `[features]` — Conditional compilation features.
- `[patch]` — Override dependencies.
- `[replace]` — Override dependencies (deprecated).
- `[profile]` — Compiler settings and optimizations.
- `[workspace]` — The workspace definition.
