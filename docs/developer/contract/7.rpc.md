Here we will only briefly mention how to use the AURA RPC.

## Testnet Profile

At the moment, there are 2 public testnet options to work with Aura Network. Depending on your interest, please choose the appropriate testnet. As Aura Network is still in development, the aura client is subjected to change frequently. To ensure the best experience of testnet users, there are 2 independent testnets at the moment: `Euphoria` and `Serenity`.

### 1. `Euphoria`, the staging testnet:
Target users: `Validator`, `App Developer`, `First-Timer` and the majority of `Aura users`.

`Euphoria` similars to the staging environment concept in traditional software development, `Euphoria` is the near exact replica of `Aura Mainnet`. This means we will try our best to bootstrap external validators, set up vesting, voting and operate the `Euphoria` bootstrap community as closely as we will do on `Aura Mainnet` in the future.

```
Network Name: Euphoria Testnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.euphoria.aura.network
ChainID: euphoria-2
Symbol: EAURA
Block Explorer URL: https://euphoria.aurascan.io/
```

### 2. `Serenity`, the stable testnet:
Target users: `App Developer`.

`Serenity` testnet is determined to be fairly stable with a minimum validator set. Users who want to get the first hand experience in Aura should try with this network. `Serenity` is publicly open to dApp builders through public RPC endpoints. However, it is not open for external validators.

```
Network Name: Serenity Testnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.serenity.aura.network
ChainID: serenity-testnet-001
Symbol: AURA
Block Explorer URL: https://serenity.aurascan.io/
```

## RPC and LCD endpoints
:::caution caution
Public endpoints should only be used in development. For live dApps, [set up your own endpoint](../../validator/running-a-fullnode.md).
