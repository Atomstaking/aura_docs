Here we will only briefly mention how to use the AURA RPC on mainnet **Xstaxy** and testnets **Euphoria** and **Serenity**.

---

## Mainnet

Mainnet's code name is `Xstaxy`. This is where you may deploy your contracts for you production dApps, keeping in mind that real value is at stake in mainnet and you should audit your code thoroughly before submitting it for deployment.

```
Network Name: Xstaxy Mainnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.aura.network
ChainID: xstaxy-1
Symbol: AURA
Block Explorer URL: https://aurascan.io/
```

## Testnet Profile

At the moment, there are two public testnet options to work with Aura Network. Depending on your interest, you may choose the appropriate testnet which best suits your development needs. As Aura Network is in constant development, the aura client is subjected to change frequently. To ensure the best experience of testnet users, there are two independent testnets at the moment: `Euphoria` and `Serenity`.

### 1. `Euphoria`, the staging testnet:
Target users: `Validator`, `App Developer`, `First-Timer` and the majority of `Aura users`.

`Euphoria` similars to the staging environment concept in traditional software development, `Euphoria` is the near exact replica of `Aura Mainnet`. This means we will try our best to bootstrap external validators, set up vesting, voting and operate the `Euphoria` bootstrap community as closely as we will do on `Aura Mainnet` in the future.

```
Network Name: Euphoria Testnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.euphoria.aura.network
ChainID: euphoria-2
Symbol: EAURA
Block Explorer URL: https://euphoria.aurascan.io/
```

### 2. `Serenity`, the stable testnet:
Target users: `App Developer`.

`Serenity` testnet is determined to be fairly stable with a minimum validator set. Users who want to get the first hand experience in Aura should try with this network. `Serenity` is publicly open to dApp builders through public RPC endpoints. However, it is not open for external validators.

```
Network Name: Serenity Testnet
RPC URL: https://rpc.serenity.aura.network
ChainID: serenity-testnet-001
Symbol: AURA
Block Explorer URL: https://serenity.aurascan.io/
```

## RPC and LCD endpoints
:::caution caution
Public endpoints should only be used in development. For live dApps, [set up your own endpoint](../../validator/running-a-fullnode.md).
