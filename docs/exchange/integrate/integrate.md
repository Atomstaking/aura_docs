# ðŸŒŸ Exchange Integration

This section is dedicated for exchanges (CEX and DEX) to integrate with Aura Network.


## 1. Native $AURA currency

Aura mainnet is developed using [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk). So if you have listed popular coins like [ATOM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cosmos-hub), the process is very similar.

- Aura Network runs on Tendermint consensus, the block is finalized instantly. 
- Currently, the expected block time is around 5 - 6 seconds. The latest block can be queried by:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="testnet" label="Euphoria Testnet">

```
curl https://lcd.euphoria.aura.network/blocks/latest
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 1.2. Node Reference

You can either run your own full node following the guide here: [Running a full node](../../validator/running-a-fullnode.md).

Or directly query public API endpoints [here](../../developer/endpoints.md).
