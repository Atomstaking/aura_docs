# ðŸŒŸ Exchange Integration

This section is dedicated for exchanges (CEX and DEX) to integrate with Aura Network.

## Native $AURA currency

Aura mainnet is developed using [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk). So if you have listed popular coins like [ATOM](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/cosmos-hub), the process is very similar.

- Aura Network runs on Tendermint consensus, the block is finalized instantly. 
- Currently, the expected block time is around 5 - 6 seconds.

There are currently 4 ways to integrate with Aura Network:

1. Use Aura Daemon command-line interface (aurad CLI)
2. Directly invoke an Aura Node client endpoints using HTTP requests
3. Use Javascript library [cosmosjs](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs)
4. Use the centralized [Horoscope](../../product/horoscope/index.md) Indexer API

## Denom
There are several denomination widely used in Aura Network.

- `AURA` or `aura` : indicates the AURA native currency on mainnet.
- `uAURA` or `uaura` : indicates the smallest unit of native currency on mainnet. 1 `aura` = 10^6 `uaura`

To avoid confusion with testnet currency, we have different denoms for tokens on testnet

- `EAURA` or `eaura` : indicates the AURA native currency on Euphoria testnet.
- `uEAURA` or `ueaura` : indicates the smallest unit of native currency on Euphoria testnet. 1 `eaura` = 10^6 `ueaura`

## Node Reference

You can either run your own full node following the guide here: [Running a full node](../../validator/running-a-fullnode.md).

Or directly query public API endpoints [here](../../developer/contract/7.rpc.md).

If you only need to interact with the `aurad` CLI, just compile it from source is enough.
