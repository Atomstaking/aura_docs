# What is Feegrant?

## Definition

Feegrant enables the granter (a user, contract, or module) to pay the fees for someone else (the grantee) when the grantee wants to broadcast a transaction on the blockchain. The granter still retains full ownership to their tokens and is able to revoke the allowance at any time.

## How many types of fee allowance?

Two fee allowance types implemented: 

*Basic Allowance*: The allowance can have a one-time limit, an expiration, or no limit.

*Periodic Allowance*: The extension type of basic allowance that can be disbursed periodically with limit amount and fix duration for each period 

## Where can I grant fee allowance to grantee?
