# Deploy a smart contract

See the guideline on [how to develop and deploy a smart contract](https://github.com/aura-nw/flower-store-contract).

After deploying a smart contract on Aurascan, see the contracts list and contract deployed transaction on Euphoria Testnet:

![Contracts List](/img/aurascan/Advanced_topic_euphoria_contracts_list.png)

:::caution Note:
* Only contracts instantiated from **verified** Code ID have green check mark icon beside in smart contract list and corresponding Code ID verified time info. 
* Unverified contracts do not have green check mark icon. 
* Each Code ID has to be verified and published source code as well as register code ID type (CW20/CW721/CW4973) beforehand so that others user can be able to interact with the smart contracts that instantiated from this Code ID.

See the instantiate contract transaction in contract details.
