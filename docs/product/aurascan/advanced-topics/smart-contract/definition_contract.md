# What is a Smart Contract?

## Definition
Smart contracts are simply programs stored on Aura Network that run when predetermined conditions are met. They typically are used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants can be immediately certain of the outcome, without any intermediary's involvement or time loss. They can also automate a workflow, triggering the next action when conditions are met.

The blockchain is then updated when the transaction is completed. That means the transaction cannot be changed, and only parties who have been granted permission can see the results.

As any modern application, smart contracts store data and expose methods to interact with them.

They are written in human-readable languages, then compiled and deployed to an account where everyone can interact with them.

## Programming Languages
Developers can use Rust to write smart contracts in Aura Network.

Rust is a programming language designed for performance and safety. It is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety without resorting to garbage collection. Rust has proven to be a mature and secure language, which makes it ideal to write smart contracts. Because of this, Rust is chosen to be the programming language for writing smart contracts on Aura Network.
