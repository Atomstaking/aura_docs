# Staking your coin

Before Aura holders start staking process, they have to connect wallet successfully.

## I. Delegate to a validator

After selecting a trusted validator, Aura holders start delegating with an amount of Aura assets and paying a transaction fee for the delegation transaction.

Please click `Delegate` your trusted validator.

## II. Claim staking rewards

Each member of staked Aura holders earn different types of revenue:
- **Block rewards** are distributed proportionally to all validators and their delegators relative to their voting power. Aura holders that do not stake do not receive rewards.
- **Transaction fees**

Delegators can get their rewards by sending a claim reward transaction, then the rewards will be sent to Aura holder's wallet automatically.

## III. Undelegate a validator

Staking will lock your funds for 2 days, so you will need to undelegate in order for your staked assets to be liquid again. This process will take 2 days to complete. Once the unbonding period begins you will:
- not receive staking rewards
- not be able to cancel the unbonding
- need to wait 2 days for the amount to be liquid

Please click `Manage` button, a pop up will show up, click on `Select Action` and choose `Undelegate` from the dropdown list.
A popup will show up with information about validator, unbonding period.
