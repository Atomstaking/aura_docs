AuraScan is a Blockchain Explorer, Search and Analytical Platform for Aura Network, a decentralized smart contracts platform.
Similar to Etherscan or Mintscan, you can check pretty much all on-chain information, such as: blocks, transactions, validators, proposals, smart contracts.

If you are developers who want an environment to test all functionalities in managing your assets on Aura Network, you can access AuraScan testnet to try:
1. Euphoria Testnet: https://euphoria.aurascan.io/
2. Serenity Testnet: https://serenity.aurascan.io/

We have [an instruction](https://docs.aura.network/overview/start/aurascan) that helps you to explore many basic functionalities on AuraScan Testnet.
