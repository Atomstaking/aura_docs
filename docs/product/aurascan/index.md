AuraScan is a not only a blockchain explorer, but also a decentralized smart contracts and analytical platform for Aura Network.

Similar to Etherscan or Mintscan, you can check pretty much all on-chain information, such as: blocks, transactions, validators, proposals, smart contracts, tokens, NFTs, and more.

Below are all available environments of AuraScan:

|Environment|Network|URL|
|----------|----------|----------|
|Production Environment	|Aura Mainnet (xstaxy-1) 			|https://aurascan.io/|
|Staging environment 	|Aura Testnet (euphoria-2)			|https://euphoria.aurascan.io/|
|Testing environment	|Aura Testnet (serenity-testnet-001)|https://serenity.aurascan.io/|

The production environment is for real, general use and will certainly be kept stable. If you are developers who want an environment to test all functionalities in managing your assets on Aura Network, as well as upcoming features, use Staging/Testing environments.

We have [an instruction](https://docs.aura.network/overview/start/aurascan) that helps you to explore many basic functionalities on AuraScan.
