# Deploy a smart contract

See the guideline on [how to develop and deploy a smart contract](https://github.com/aura-nw/flower-store-contract).

After deploying a smart contract on aurad, see the contract and instantiate contract transaction on Aurascan Testnet.

Here is the contracts list on Euphoria Testnet.

:::caution Note:
Only verified contracts have green check mark icons, unverified contracts do not have green check mark icons. 
Contract's owners have to verify and publish contract source code and register type contract for your smart contract.
