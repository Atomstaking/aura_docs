# Connect your wallet

All co-owners must have a personal wallet connected. For now, Pyxis Safe only supports Keplr wallet. Please click the drop-down section right next to the network selection, then click “Connect”.

Proceed with the wallet connection on the Keplr wallet browser extension itself. There might be a confirmation prompt from the Keplr wallet if you have not added the network to your wallet in advance. 

After successfully connect to the network, you will have to sign a message to generate an access token. Proceed to continue.
