title: Connect your wallet
---

Before doing anything with Pyxis Safe, you will have to connect your personal wallet. The personal wallet will act as the safe owner who will be able to create, sign, execute transaction, and more. 

# Network selection

First of all, please select the network that you will be working on from our list of supported networks, which is located in the top-right corner. A drop-down list will be shown for you to choose. In this case, “Senerity Testnet” was chosen.

# Connect your wallet

All co-owners must have a personal wallet connected. For now, Pyxis Safe only supports Keplr wallet. Please click the drop-down section right next to the network selection, then click “Connect”.

Proceed with the wallet connection on the Keplr wallet browser extension itself. There might be a confirmation prompt from the Keplr wallet if you have not added the network to your wallet in advance. 

After successfully connect to the network, you will have to sign a message to generate an access token. Proceed to continue.
