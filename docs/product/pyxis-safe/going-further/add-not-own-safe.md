title: Add a Safe you do not own

Additionally, if you want to keep track of safes that you do not own, you can also add them to your safe list. The safes that you do not own will be rendered as Read-Only, so that you can see the transactions of that safe. 

Click “Add existing Safe” (if you have a Safe managed already, you can click “Add Safe” on the Safe list to go back to the Safe creation/addition screen).

This time, you will have to choose the network in which the safe exists and input the safe address yourself. The address of the safe will be queried. If a safe is found, the owners will be loaded. 

The Safe and owners naming process will be the same as above. However, the safe will be shown as Read-Only.
