# Allow Safe creation
The safe must be allowed by all other co-owners before it can be put into use. In the safe list of a co-owner, the safes that need confirmation will look like below. Clicking “Allow” will start the process of adding the Safe into the Safe list of that owner.

The co-owner has to define the name of the Safe, as well as the Name of other co-owners of the safe to proceed. The process is basically the same as creating a new safe, but without any owner or confirmation declaration.

A pop-up will be shown indicating that you have finished the process.


The safe is now marked as “Allowed”.

After all co-owners have gone through the process of Safe allowance, the Safe will not be marked as “pending” anymore, but instead active and can be managed.
