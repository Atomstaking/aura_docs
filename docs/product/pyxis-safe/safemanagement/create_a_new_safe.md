You will be guided through the process of creating a new safe, which consists of 4 steps:

## Step 1: Connect wallet and select network 

This is to confirm your previous network selection. You can switch to another network at this step if needed by clicking on “Switch Network” or doing the above Network Selection process again. When you are good to proceed, click “Continue”.

## Step 2: Name your safe
 
Be aware that this name is only stored locally on your browser’s cache. You will have to name it again when you add the safe on other browsers/devices. Click “Continue” to proceed to the next step.

## Step 3: Owners and Confirmation

- Owners: In this part of the step, you are required to declare every other owner of the Safe, apart from yourself (which has been included by default). By clicking “+ Add another owner”, you will be able to declare an owner’s name (locally stored, again) and wallet address. You can remove the unwanted owner(s) by clicking the trash bin icon next to that owner. An owner’s wallet address can also be obtained by scanning a QR code.

- Confirmation: In this part of the step, you are required to define how many confirmations from all the co-owners that a transaction is needed to acquire before it can be executed. You can select the number from the drop-down list and the value will range from 1 to the maximum amount of declared owner. When you are good to proceed, click “Continue”.

## Step 4: Review
In this step, you will have the chance to review all the declared information of the Safe that you are about to create. Click “Back” if you need to go back to change any of them. Otherwise, click “Create” to create the Safe.

A confirmation screen will show up as below, which indicates that your safe creation request has been created. All the other co-owneSrs have to allow the safe creation in order to activate the safe and put it in to use. You can either click “Continue” or close the pop-up.
