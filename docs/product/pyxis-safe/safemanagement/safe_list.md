# Safe list

To access your safe list, click on the arrow button on the left side of the UI. A sidebar will appear, showing all of your current and previously and in-progress created Safes. This will be explained further in specific features later on. You can manage multiple Safes that you own at a time. Every Safe must be added locally in order to be managed. The green tick marks the safe which is being managed at the moment.
