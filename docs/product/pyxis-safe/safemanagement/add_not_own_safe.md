# Add a Safe you do not own
Additionally, if you want to keep track of safes that you do not own, you also can add them to your safe list. The safes that you do not own will be rendered as Read-Only, so that you can see the transaction of that safe. Click “Add existing Safe” (if you have a Safe managed already, you can click “Add Safe” on the Safe list to go back to the Safe creation/addition screen)

This time, you will have to choose the network that contains the safe and input the safe address yourself. The address of the safe will be searched. If a safe is found, the owner will be loaded. The Safe and owners naming will be the same as above processes. However, the safe after addition will be marked as Read-Only.
