title: Connect your wallet

Before doing anything with Pyxis Safe, you will have to connect your personal wallet. The personal wallet will act as the safe owner who will be able to create, sign, execute transaction, and more. 

# Network selection

First of all, please select the network that you will be working on from our list of supported networks, which is located in the top-right corner. A drop-down list will be shown for you to choose.

<div className='player-wrapper'>
    <ReactPlayer

Choose your desired wallet and Proceed with the wallet connection on the wallet browser extension itself. There might be a confirmation prompt from the wallet if you have not added the network to your wallet in advance.

After successfully connect to the network, you will have to sign a message to generate an access token. Proceed to continue.
