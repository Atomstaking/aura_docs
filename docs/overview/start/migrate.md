# Migrate from BSC
The long wait is over, Aura Network mainnet (code name Xstaxy) was successfully launched at 13:00 UTC 20th March 2023. However, this is just the first milestone on the journey to bring NFTs to mass adoption that Aura Network committed to deliver.
Following the mainnet launch, there are several steps for the current Aura token holders to do to migrate their tokens from BSC to Xstaxy:

## 1. Through Centralized Exchange
The first Centralized Exchange to support Xstaxy is BingX:

https://support.bingx.com/hc/en-001/articles/16547008282265

Following our integration, by 8:00 UTC 22nd March 2023 you will be able to deposit BEP-20 Aura tokens from BSC to BingX and withdraw to Xstaxy. Please be noted that this action is irreversible, centralized exchange users will not be able to withdraw $AURA to BSC anymore. The BEP-20 tokens deposited on BingX will be burned.

The procedure is straightforward, just deposit your BEP-20 Aura on BSC to BingX and withdraw it to Xstaxy mainnet.

## 2. Trustless bridge through Axelar
If you prefer a decentralized bridge solution for token migration, we are integrating with Axelar Network to allow a trustless bridge between Xstaxy and BSC. The integration is currently available on Serenity and Euphoria testnet and will be published later by May.

## 3. Why should I migrate my BEP-20 Tokens to Xstaxy?
All DApps built on Aura Network function using native Aura tokens on the Xstaxy mainnet. You can only use them if you migrate your tokens. Also, all centralized exchanges will only integrate with Xstaxy from now on.

## 4. What will happen with my BEP-20 tokens if I donâ€™t migrate?
Nothing will happen for now. We believe that token migration is voluntary so you can keep your BEP-20 tokens as long as you wish. However, as all activities will now happen on Xstaxy, you will miss a significant opportunity to ape in Aura Network and get all benefits from the project.
