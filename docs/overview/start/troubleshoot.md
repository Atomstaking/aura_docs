Screen recording and upload video to cloud is the most effective way of telling us what problem you are facing. You can use whatever tool you like then upload the recorded video to a cloud service and share us the link.

- If you use a Mac, screen recording is supported out of the box. Just follow the tutorial here: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721
- We perfer to use a Chrome extension: [Awesome Screenshot and Screen Recorder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-and-sc/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj).
