# Governing the network

## I. What is governance?
Aura stakers have the right to vote on proposals that affect the evolution of the Aura Network. Proposals can be submitted by all Aura holders, but only proposals that come with a sufficient deposit (current minimum deposit is 64 Aura) are eligible to be voted on. Deposits can be crowdfunded, the user submitting the proposal do not need to provide entirely.
After a proposal gets a sufficient deposit, it enters the voting period that lasts 7 days. Aura stakers can vote on active proposals, with a voting power that is proportional to their amount of staked Aura. If the Aura stakers do not vote, they inherit the vote from the validators they delegated to.

## II. Connect a wallet
To vote on an active proposal, you must connect a wallet successfully first.
See [here](../start/wallet) to know how to setup your wallet.

## III. Stake Aura
