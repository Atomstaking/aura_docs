# Introduction
Aura Network is a layer-1, NFT-centric blockchain that focuses on expanding the use of NFTs across various industries. Our vision is to create a one-stop destination for minting, evaluating, querying, and transacting NFTs, to become a pioneer NFT infrastructure for the future.

Aura Network provides 3 main features:

- A universal framework for all stakeholders to create a one stop destination for developing new NFT use cases.
- A multi-chain platform that can support both crypto communities and traditional businesses.
- An infrastructure layer for building and integrating your applications to the metaverse

Aura Network is built using [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk), the world's most used framework for building blockchains.

To learn more about the vision and growth strategy of Aura Network, please take a look at our [Whitepaper](https://github.com/aura-nw/whitepaper/blob/main/release/Aura_Network___whitepaper.pdf)

The Aura ecosystem can be divided into 4 layers

- ðŸ–¥ Infrastructure: contains all resources relating to the underlying blockchain platform. This includes the node client [Aurad](https://github.com/aura-nw/aura) and all resources such as genesis block, configuration files and deployed services serving the Aura Network blockchain.
- ðŸ’° Currency: There are 2 native currencies of the Aura ecosystem: Aura Coin and Aura Token on BNB Smart Chain. Aura also supports creating CW20 tokens, similar to other blockchains that use CosmWasm module.
- ðŸ…° dApps: applications that offer rich user experience in working with DeFi and NFT. The list is continuously growing, but we have several things in mind at the moment (The green ones are what we are working on, gray ones are reserved for future development/collaboration):
    - *Wallet*: Crypto wallet for Aura Network. We are supporting Coin98 Wallet and Keplr.
    - *Aurascan*: the blockchain explorer with extra features for governing, staking, NFT, notifications, etc. that are tailored towards Aura holders.
