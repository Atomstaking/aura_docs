# Environment Setup
In order to start building a smart contract, you must setup all necessary in your computer.

Aura uses [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/), a WebAssembly smart contract platform (or module) that integrate natively with [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk). Smart contracts are written in [RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org/), compiled into Wasm then uploaded to the Aura chain.

You can learn more about CosmWasm in the official [Cosmwasm document](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/1.0/).

## Prerequisites

To develop any smart contract you will need to you will to install Node.js. If you further want to use Rust as your main language, then you need to install `rustup` as well.

### Node.js
Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We suggest you should install Node through NVM(Node version manager), what allows you to quickly install and use different versions of node via the command line.
```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.2/install.sh | bash
```

Other, we further recommend install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) to manage node-module package: 
```bash
npm install -g yarn
```

### Go

Aura require go version newer than 1.18. You can use GVM(Golang version manager) to manage all Go version on your machine. To install: 
```bash
bash < <(curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moovweb/gvm/master/binscripts/gvm-installer)
```

#### Install go
```bash
gvm install go1.18.7 -B
gvm use go1.18.7
```

Once this is done Go will be in the path and ready to use. $GOROOT and $GOPATH are set automatically.

Check version of Go using:
```bash
go version
```

### Rust

#### Install rust
Download and install Rust using following line:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Config environment variable
```bash
sudo nano ~/.profile
```

Add to the end of `~/.bashrc` the following line:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Then check `cargo` version and update `rustup`:
```bash
rustup default stable
cargo version
# If this is lower than 1.55.0, update
rustup update stable
```

You also must install `cargo-generate` and `cargo-run-script` by following commands:
```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

### wasm
`wasmd` is the backbone of the CosmWasm platform. It is the implementation of a Cosmos zone with wasm smart contracts enabled.

#### Install the `wasm32` target
```bash
# Check the target toolchains of rustup
rustup target list --installed
# Add the wasm toolchain
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Docker
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications [link-download](https://www.docker.com/).

### Beaker tools
Beaker is a tool use to scaffold a new cosmwasm app, with all of the dependencies for osmosis hooked up, interactive console, and a sample front-end at the ready.
You can install through cargo what is a rust toolchain. Make sure you installed cargo on your machine.
```bash
cargo install -f beaker # `-f` flag for up-to-date version
```

### Command-line tools
We will be using a few command-line tools extensively:
```bash
apt install jq curl
```

## Install Aura deamon

Aurad binary is the official client for Aura Network. To install it, you need to clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:aura-nw/aura.git
```
And using makefile:
```bash
cd aura
make
```
The aurad bin file will be located on ${source_directory}/build/ or GO_PATH (default ~/go/bin/)

## Using Aura testnet with a public node

1. Get a public node's RPC address. These can be found pinned in Discord.
2. In `~/.aura/config/client.toml` set `node="https://rpc.euphoria.aura.network:443"` and `chain-id="euphoria-1"`.
3. Create a key to use by running `aurad keys add <key-name>`.
4. Get that key's public address by running `aurad keys show <key-name> -a`.
5. Get some test Aura by sending `$I love Aura <key-address>` in the #faucet Discord channel.

You can then verify that you have funds by running `aurad query bank balances <key-address>`. Happy hacking!
