# ExecuteMsg
Alright, it's time to head back to a file we're familiar with, the `src/lib.rs` of `package/sg721`.

You've written message `InstantiateMsg` before, so I have faith you'll pick this up pretty quick. The `ExecuteMsg` implementations of `gs721` follow the [CW721 spec](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/HEAD/packages/cw721/README.md). Beyond that, we make an additions: `ExecuteMsg::Mint{token_id, owner, token_uri}` - creates a new token with given owner and (optional) metadata. It can only be called by the Minter set in `instantiate`.
It requires all tokens to have defined metadata in the standard format (with no extensions). For generic NFTs this may often be enough.
If provided, it is expected that the `token_uri` points to a JSON file following the [ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

Let's open the `src/lib.rs` in the `package/sg721` and take a look at `ExecuteMsg`:
```rust
pub enum ExecuteMsg<T> {
    /// Called by the minter to put a collection contract in the ready state.
    /// When ready it means the factory and minter are properly setup.
    _Ready {},

    /// Transfer is a base message to move a token to another account without triggering actions
    TransferNft { recipient: String, token_id: String },
    /// Send is a base message to transfer a token to a contract and trigger an action
    /// on the receiving contract.
    SendNft {
        contract: String,
        token_id: String,
        msg: Binary,
    },
    /// Allows operator to transfer / send the token from the owner's account.
    /// If expiration is set, then this allowance has a time/height limit
    Approve {
        spender: String,
        token_id: String,
        expires: Option<Expiration>,
    },
    /// Remove previously granted Approval
    Revoke { spender: String, token_id: String },
    /// Allows operator to transfer / send any token from the owner's account.
    /// If expiration is set, then this allowance has a time/height limit
    ApproveAll {
        operator: String,
        expires: Option<Expiration>,
    },
    /// Remove previously granted ApproveAll permission
    RevokeAll { operator: String },
    /// Mint a new NFT, can only be called by the contract minter
    Mint(MintMsg<T>),
    /// Burn an NFT the sender has access to
    Burn { token_id: String },
}
```

`ExecuteMsg` is an enum so it can contain a whole array of values. To put it in plain terms, we only have one type of `InstantiateMsg` but we already have nine types of `ExecuteMsg`: `_Ready`, `TransferNft`, `SendNft`, `Approve`, `Revoke`, `ApproveAll`, `RevokeAll`, `Mint` and `Burn`.
We will describe each message so that we can better understand their function.

Thes first type of `ExecuteMsg`:
```rust
_Ready {}
```

This is a special message that is called by the Minter to put a collection contract in the ready state. When contract is ready it means the factory and Minter are properly setup.

------------------
A transfer NFT message includes:
- `recipient`: the account who will receive NFT
- `token_id`: the ID of NFT that will be transfered

```rust
TransferNft {
    recipient: String,
    token_id: String
}
```

------------------

A send NFT message has 3 arguments:
- `contract`: the address contract of NFT that user want to send
- `token_id`: the ID of NFT that will be sent
- `msg`: a message the owner want to send along the NFT

```rust
SendNft {
    contract: String,
    token_id: String,
    msg: Binary,
}
```

------------------
An approve message includes:
- `spender`: an account who will be granted permission to transfer or send the given NFT.
- `token_id`: the ID of NFT that `spender` can transfer of send.
- `exprires`: the period for which `spender` is granted permission.

```rust
Approve {
    spender: String,
    token_id: String,
    expires: Option<Expiration>,
}
```

------------------
The revoke message:
- `spender`: the account who will be revoked permission to transfer or send the given NFT.
- `token_id`: the ID of NFT that `spender` will be revoked permission to transfer of send.

```rust
Revoke { 
    spender: String,
    token_id: String
}
```

------------------
An approveAll message includes:
- `operator`: an account who will be granted permission to transfer or send all NFT of user.
- `exprires`: the period for which `spender` is granted permission.

```rust
ApproveAll {
    operator: String,
    expires: Option<Expiration>,
}
```

------------------
An revokeAll message includes:
- `operator`: the account who will be revoked permission to transfer or send all NFT of user.

```rust
RevokeAll {
    operator: String
}
```

------------------
Mint is a special message with an argument `MintMsg`
```rust
Mint(MintMsg<T>)
```

`MintMsg` is:
```rust
pub struct MintMsg<T> {
    /// Unique ID of the NFT
    pub token_id: String,
    /// The owner of the newly minter NFT
    pub owner: String,
    /// Universal resource identifier for this NFT
    /// Should point to a JSON file that conforms to the ERC721
    /// Metadata JSON Schema
    pub token_uri: Option<String>,
    /// Any custom extension used by this contract
    pub extension: T,
}
```

------------------
The burn message will has a `token_id`, the ID of NFT that `spender` will be burned

```rust
Burn {
    token_id: String
}
```
