# ExecuteMsg
You've written message `InstantiateMsg` before, so I have faith you'll pick this up pretty quick. The `ExecuteMsg` implementations of `aura-nft` follow the [CW721 spec](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-nfts/blob/HEAD/packages/cw721/README.md).
It requires all tokens to have defined metadata in the standard format (with no extensions). For generic NFTs this may often be enough.
If provided, it is expected that the `token_uri` points to a JSON file following the [ERC721 Metadata JSON Schema](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721).

Let's open the `src/msg.rs` and take a look at `ExecuteMsg`:
```rust
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    /// Mint a new NFT
    Mint { token_id: u32 },
    /// Mint a batch of new NFT
    BatchMint { token_ids: Vec<u32> },
    /// Mint a new NFT for recipient specified
    MintTo { token_id: u32, recipient: String },
    /// Transfer is a base message to move a token to another account without triggering actions
    TransferNft { recipient: String, token_id: u32 },

    /// Transfer is a base message to move a batch token to another account without triggering actions
    BatchTransferNft {
        recipient: String,
        token_ids: Vec<u32>,
    },
}
```

`ExecuteMsg` is an enum so it can contain a whole array of values. To put it in plain terms, we only have one type of `InstantiateMsg` but we already have five types of `ExecuteMsg`: `Mint`, `BatchMint`, `MintTo`, `TransferNft` and `BatchTransferNft`.
We will describe each message so that we can better understand their function.

Thes first type of `ExecuteMsg`, Mint. Mint is a special message with an argument `token_id`. It is the ID of NFT will be minted.
```rust
Mint { 
    token_id: u32
}
```

------------------
The batch mint message has a vector of ID:
```rust
BatchMint {
    token_ids: Vec<u32>
}
```

------------------
The message will be used for minting NFT to a account includes:
- `token_id`: the ID of NFT will be minted
- `recipient`: the account who will receive NFT

```rust
MintTo {
    token_id: u32,
    recipient: String
}
```

------------------
A transfer NFT message includes:
- `recipient`: the account who will receive NFT
- `token_id`: the ID of NFT that will be transfered

```rust
TransferNft {
    recipient: String,
    token_id: String
}
```

------------------
To transfer a batch of NFT, we use the message has 2 arguments:
- `recipient`: the account who will receive NFTs
- `token_ids`: the IDs array of NFTs will be transfered

```rust
 BatchTransferNft {
    recipient: String,
    token_ids: Vec<u32>,
}
```
