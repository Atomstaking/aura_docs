# Testing

Testing are vital to smart contract development, every developer should be implementing tests and striving to maximize test coverage. Tests are what give you and your protocol sleep at night and ensure changes can be rapidly deployed to the contracts codebase without breaking everything else. A great set of contracts will have a great set of tests generally divided into two areas of testing. Unit testing and Integration testing.

But in this aura-nft project, because of its logic simplicity, we will only need write unit tests. About `Integration Testing`, you can read [more here][intergrate-test].

So let's look at our `contract.rs` file, at the bottom, there should be something that looks like this:

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {}
```

This module is where we will implement our tests, the flag above shows it is for testing.

Here we have a total of 10 unit tests. Their code is quite long so I will only choose 1 important unit test to explain to you about the idea and syntax. The other unit tests, I will describe what they test, all you need to do is refer to the source code and try to rewrite them yourself.

```
#[test]
    fn initialization() {}

#[test]
    fn invalid_unit_price() {}

#[test]
    fn invalid_max_tokens() {}

#[test]
    fn mint() {}

#[test]
    fn invalid_reply_id() {}

#[test]
    fn cw721_already_linked() {}

#[test]
    fn sold_out() {}

#[test]
    fn uninitialized() {}

#[test]
    fn unauthorized_token() {}

#[test]
    fn wrong_amount() {}
```
