This message allows user transfering ownership of the token with `token_id` to `recipient` account. This is designed to send to an address controlled by a private key and does not trigger any actions on the recipient if it is a contract. Requires token_id to point to a valid token, and env.sender to be the owner of it, or have an allowance to transfer it.
