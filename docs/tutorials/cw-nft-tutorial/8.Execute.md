# Execute
This part will describle the core execution logic.

Let's take a look at function `execute` in `src/contract.rs`.
```rust
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Mint { token_id } => execute_mint_sender(deps, info, token_id),
        ExecuteMsg::BatchMint { token_ids } => execute_batch_mint_sender(deps, info, token_ids),
        ExecuteMsg::MintTo {
            token_id,
            recipient,
        } => execute_mint_to(deps, info, recipient, token_id),
        ExecuteMsg::TransferNft {
            recipient,
            token_id,
        } => execute_transfer_nft(deps, info, recipient, token_id),
        ExecuteMsg::BatchTransferNft {
            recipient,
            token_ids,
        } => execute_batch_transfer_nft(deps, info, recipient, token_ids),
    }
}
```

Corresponding to five `ExecuteMsg`, we will have five `execute` function. Each function will receive the arguments corresponding to the parameters of `ExecuteMsg`.

The first function is `execute_mint_sender` with the `ExecuteMsg::Mint`:
```rust
pub fn execute_mint_sender(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    token_id: u32,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let recipient = info.sender.clone();
    _execute_mint(deps, info, Some(recipient), Some(token_id))
}
```
This function will mint a NFT with the `token_id` to the sender.

------------------

The function `execute_batch_mint_sender` corresponds with `ExecuteMsg::BatchMint` will mint an list of NFTs to the sender:
```rust
pub fn execute_batch_mint_sender(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    token_ids: Vec<u32>,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let recipient = info.sender.clone();
    _execute_batch_mint(deps, info, Some(recipient), token_ids)
}
```

------------------

The function `execute_mint_to` uses message `ExecuteMsg::MintTo`:
```rust
pub fn execute_mint_to(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    recipient: String,
    token_id: u32,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let recipient = deps.api.addr_validate(&recipient)?;
    _execute_mint(deps, info, Some(recipient), Some(token_id))
}
```
There is a slight difference at here. Instead of minting NFT for the `sender` like two previous functions, the function `execute_mint_to` will mint a NFT for a specified account, the `recipient`.

------------------

The transfer function `execute_transfer_nft`:
```rust
pub fn execute_transfer_nft(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    recipient: String,
    token_id: u32,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let recipient = deps.api.addr_validate(&recipient)?;
    _execute_transfer_nft(deps, info, recipient, token_id)
}
```
This function allows user transfering ownership of the token with `token_id` to `recipient` account. This is designed to send to an address controlled by a private key and does not trigger any actions on the recipient if it is a contract. Requires `token_id` to point to a valid token, and `env.sender` to be the owner of it, or have an allowance to transfer it.

------------------

The final execute function is `execute_batch_transfer_nft`:
```rust
pub fn execute_batch_transfer_nft(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    recipient: String,
    token_ids: Vec<u32>,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let recipient = deps.api.addr_validate(&recipient)?;
    _execute_batch_transfer_nft(deps, info, recipient, token_ids)
}
```
The `execute_batch_transfer_nft` function allows user transfering ownership of a list of tokens with `token_ids` to `recipient` account.
