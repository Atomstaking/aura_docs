# Overview
Welcome to CosmWasm Smart Contract guide, from Aura Network. 

CosmWasm is a smart contracting platform built for the Cosmos ecosystem. CosmWasm is written as a module that can plug into the Cosmos SDK. It runs the Web Assembly (or Wasm) virtual machine, allowing developers to create smart contracts in various languages. Currently, it supports smart contracts written in Rust.

In this series, you will explore CosmWasm from a familiar usecase of smart contracts - non-fungible token (NFT). We'll start by looking at the code for the cw721 NFT standard contract from CosmWasm Plus. Then, we'll launch an NFT contract on Aura testnet and create and send some NFTs.

Now let's begin!
