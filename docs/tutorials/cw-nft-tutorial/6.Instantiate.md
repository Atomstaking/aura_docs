# Instantiating a Contract
When contracts are stored on the chain they must be instantiated. I cover storing contracts on a chain in a later section. Instantiating a contract is like creating an object in other languages, however, it is achieved by a special message. This message is an `InstantiateMsg` located under `src/lib.rs` of `package/sg721`.
Let's add something to it!

## The InstantiateMsg
When a user instantiates the NFT contract, he must specify the `name` and `symbol` (for metadata) of NFT, as well as a `minter` address. This is a special address that has full power to mint new NFTs (but not modify existing ones).

Our `InstantiateMsg` looks like this:
```rust
pub struct InstantiateMsg {
    pub name: String,
    pub symbol: String,
    pub minter: String,
    pub collection_info: CollectionInfo<RoyaltyInfoResponse>,
}
```
The `minter` can either be an external actor (e.g. web server, using PubKey) or another contract. If you just want to customize the minting behavior but not other functionality, you could extend this contract (importing code and wiring it together) or just create a custom contract as the owner and use that contract to Mint.

## Instantiation
The instantiation code is implemented in `src/contract.rs`:
```rust
pub fn instantiate(
    &self,
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: InstantiateMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    // no funds should be sent to this contract
    nonpayable(&info)?;

    // cw721 instantiation
    let info = ContractInfoResponse {
        name: msg.name,
        symbol: msg.symbol,
    };
    self.parent.contract_info.save(deps.storage, &info)?;

    let minter = deps.api.addr_validate(&msg.minter)?;
    self.parent.minter.save(deps.storage, &minter)?;

    // sg721 instantiation
    if msg.collection_info.description.len() > MAX_DESCRIPTION_LENGTH as usize {
        return Err(ContractError::DescriptionTooLong {});
    }

    let image = Url::parse(&msg.collection_info.image)?;

    if let Some(ref external_link) = msg.collection_info.external_link {
        Url::parse(external_link)?;
    }

    let royalty_info: Option<RoyaltyInfo> = match msg.collection_info.royalty_info {
        Some(royalty_info) => Some(RoyaltyInfo {
            payment_address: deps.api.addr_validate(&royalty_info.payment_address)?,
            share: share_validate(royalty_info.share)?,
        }),
        None => None,
    };

    deps.api.addr_validate(&msg.collection_info.creator)?;

    let collection_info = CollectionInfo {
        creator: msg.collection_info.creator,
        description: msg.collection_info.description,
        image: msg.collection_info.image,
        external_link: msg.collection_info.external_link,
        royalty_info,
    };

    self.collection_info.save(deps.storage, &collection_info)?;

    self.ready.save(deps.storage, &false)?;

    Ok(Response::new()
        .add_attribute("action", "instantiate")
        .add_attribute("collection_name", info.name)
        .add_attribute("image", image.to_string()))
}
```
The instantiate has 4 arguments:
- `deps` - The dependencies, this contains your contract storage, the ability to query other contracts and balances, and some API functionality.
- `env` - The environment, contains contract information such as its address, block information such as current height and time, as well as some optional transaction info.
- `info` - Message metadata, contains the sender of the message (`Addr`) and the funds sent with it a `Vec<Coin>`.
- `msg` - The `InstantiateMsg` you define in `package/sg721/src/lib.rs`.
