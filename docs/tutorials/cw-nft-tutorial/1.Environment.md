# Environment Setup
In order to start building a smart contract you need to first properly setup your computer.

Aura uses [CosmWasm](https://cosmwasm.com/), a WebAssembly smart contract platform (or module) that integrate natively with [Cosmos SDK](https://v1.cosmos.network/sdk). Smart contracts are written in [RUST](https://www.rust-lang.org/), compiled into Wasm then uploaded to the Aura chain.

You can learn more about CosmWasm in the official [Cosmwasm document](https://docs.cosmwasm.com/docs/1.0/).

## Prerequisites

To develop any smart contract you will need to you will to install Node.js. If you further want to use Rust as your main language, then you need to install `rustup` as well.

### Node.js
Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). We further recommend to install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com): 
```
npm install -g yarn
```

### Go

#### Download Go
```bash
curl -o go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz https://dl.google.com/go/go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

#### Install
**Remove any previous Go installation** by deleting the `/usr/local/go` folder (if it exists), then extract the archive you just downloaded into `/usr/local`, creating a fresh Go tree in `/usr/local/go`:
```bash
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/go && sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz && rm -r go1.19.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

#### Config environment variable
Add to the end of `~/.bashrc` the following line:
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
```

Check version of Go using:
```bash
go version
```

### Rust

#### Install rust
Download and install Rust using following line:
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

#### Config environment variable
Add to the end of `~/.bashrc` the following line:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.cargo/bin:$PATH"
```

Then check `cargo` version and update `rustup`:
```bash
rustup default stable
cargo version
# If this is lower than 1.55.0, update
rustup update stable
```

You also must install `cargo-generate` and `cargo-run-script` by following commands:
```bash
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
cargo install cargo-run-script
```

### wasm
`wasmd` is the backbone of the CosmWasm platform. It is the implementation of a Cosmos zone with wasm smart contracts enabled.

#### Install the `wasm32` target
```bash
# Check the target toolchains of rustup
rustup target list --installed
# Add the wasm toolchain
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Run the following commands to install `wasmd`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd.git
cd wasmd
# If you are updating wasmd, first update your local repository by fetching the remote tags available
git fetch --tags
# replace the v0.27.0 with the most stable version on https://github.com/CosmWasm/wasmd/releases
git checkout v0.27.0
make install
```

Before checking version of `wasmd`, you must config environment variable for wasm by adding following line into the end of `./bashrc` file:
```bash
export WASMD_PATH="$HOME/go/bin"
export PATH="$WASMD_PATH:$PATH"
``` 
Then, check the version of `wasmd`:
```bash
# verify the installation
wasmd version
```

### Command-line tools
We will be using a few command-line tools extensively:
```bash
apt install jq curl
```

## Install Aura deamon

Aurad binary is the official client for Aura Network. To install it, you need to clone this repo:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:aura-nw/aura.git
```
And using makefile:
```bash
cd aura
make
```
The aurad bin file will be located on ${source_directory}/build/ or GO_PATH (default ~/go/bin/)

## Create your Aura account

You need an Aura account to interact with our chain.
```bash
aurad keys add my-wallet
```
After using this bash scripts, you can see in your terminal:
```
- name: my-wallet
  type: local
  address: aura1gzd29wdqwdc9vgumrhnml27nze7gm6w06f38s9
  pubkey: '{"@type":"/cosmos.crypto.secp256k1.PubKey","key":"A7UGMucEIG4Q5XTkI4tD2pMSEqjswkTKUh86jESvTSvx"}'
  mnemonic: ""


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.
