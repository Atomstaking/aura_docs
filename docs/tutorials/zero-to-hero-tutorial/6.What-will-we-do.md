# What will we build?
We're not going to write code for this chapter. Instead, I am going to give an overview of what we will be building.

In chapter 3, we created our own Cw20 token on the Aura testnet. Save its address, because it will be used for what we build in this series.

So what do we build, with what features?  We will create a fixed-price-nft contract. It allows users to pay a fee in Cw20 tokens and get one new NFT in return. It's simple, isn't it? But it is enough for us to go through and learn the concepts and materials that make up a Cosmwasm smart contract.

In the next chapter, I promise we will write some code!
