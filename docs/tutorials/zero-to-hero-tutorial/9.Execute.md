# Execute
In this chapter, we will write core execution logic for our contract.

## Define ExecuteMsg
Alright, it's time to head back to a file we're familiar with `src/msg.rs`. Our `ExecuteMsg` looks like this:

```rust
pub enum ExecuteMsg {
    Receive(Cw20ReceiveMsg),
}
```

`Cw20ReceiveMsg` should be de/serialized under `Receive()` variant in a ExecuteMsg. `Receive` must be implemented by any contract that wishes to manage CW20 tokens.

```rust
pub struct Cw20ReceiveMsg {
    pub sender: String,
    pub amount: Uint128,
    pub msg: Binary,
}
```

About `Cw20ReceiveMsg`, it is a struct that has three fields: `sender`, `amount` and `msg`. The `sender` is the original account requesting to move the tokens and `msg` is a Binary data that can be decoded into a contract-specific message. `amount` is the amount of Cw20 tokens sent from `sender` to the contract.

So what's the idea here? Users will send some Cw20 tokens to our contract with an msg requesting the contract to mint one NFT for them.

## Write execution logic
So now we implemented our execute messages, let's take a look at `src/contract.rs` to write execute logic.

```rust
#[cfg_attr(not(feature = "library"), entry_point)]
pub fn execute(
    deps: DepsMut,
    _env: Env,
    info: MessageInfo,
    msg: ExecuteMsg,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    match msg {
        ExecuteMsg::Receive(Cw20ReceiveMsg {
            sender,
            amount,
            msg,
        }) => execute_receive(deps, info, sender, amount, msg),
    }
}

pub fn execute_receive(
    deps: DepsMut,
    info: MessageInfo,
    sender: String,
    amount: Uint128,
    _msg: Binary,
) -> Result<Response, ContractError> {
    let mut config = CONFIG.load(deps.storage)?;
    if config.cw20_address != info.sender {
        return Err(ContractError::UnauthorizedTokenContract {});
    }

    if config.cw721_address == None {
        return Err(ContractError::Uninitialized {});
    }

    if config.unused_token_id >= config.max_tokens {
        return Err(ContractError::SoldOut {});
    }

    if amount != config.unit_price {
        return Err(ContractError::WrongPaymentAmount {});
    }

    let mint_msg = Cw721ExecuteMsg::<Extension, Empty>::Mint(MintMsg::<Extension> {
        token_id: config.unused_token_id.to_string(),
        owner: sender,
        token_uri: config.token_uri.clone().into(),
        extension: config.extension.clone(),
    });

    match config.cw721_address.clone() {
        Some(cw721) => {
            let callback =
                Cw721Contract::<Empty, Empty>(cw721, PhantomData, PhantomData).call(mint_msg)?;
            config.unused_token_id += 1;
            CONFIG.save(deps.storage, &config)?;

            Ok(Response::new().add_message(callback))
        }
        None => Err(ContractError::Cw721NotLinked {}),
    }
}
```

In `execute` function, we use Rust's enum pattern matching to `match` the `msg` variable for all its different types. Here, our `ExecuteMsg` has only one variant is a tuple struct: `Receive(Cw20ReceiveMsg{sender,amount,msg})`. After determining type of the `msg` message variable is `Cw20ReceiveMsg`, we will use `=>` to call the `execute_receive` function with its input is `deps`, `info`, `sender`, `amount`, `msg`.

Now, let's define the logic of `execute_receive` function. 

In the first line, by using `load()`, we get the `CONFIG` Item data previously stored in the store and assign it to a `config` variable. Note that the `mut` keyword is used here because in this function we will modify the data of `config`.

The next four if statements is the logic to validate four fields: `config.cw20_address`, `config.cw721_address`, `config.unused_token_id`, and `amount`.
 - Firstly, if `config.cw20_address` is not equal to `info.sender`, the `UnauthorizedTokenContract` error is returned because our contract only accepts Cw20 tokens with token contract address specified in `config`.
 - Secondy, if `config.cw721_address` is None, the `Uninitialized` error will be returned. 
 - Thirdly, if `config.unused_token_id` is greater than or equal to `config.max_tokens`, the `SoldOut` error will be returned. Because it means that the number of NFTs minted has reached the maximum, and the contract cannot receive Cw20 tokens to mint any more NFTs.
 - Fourth, if `amount` is not equal to `config.unit_price`, the `WrongPaymentAmount` will be returned because the fixed minting fee of one NFT must be equal to unit_price.
 
 Let define these 4 errors in `src/error.rs`.

 ```rust
pub enum ContractError {

    // Previous code omitted

    #[error("SoldOut")]
    SoldOut {},

    #[error("UnauthorizedTokenContract")]
    UnauthorizedTokenContract {},

    #[error("Uninitialized")]
    Uninitialized {},

    #[error("WrongPaymentAmount")]
    WrongPaymentAmount {},

    #[error("Cw721NotLinked")]
    Cw721NotLinked {},
    // Following code omitted
}
```

In the next line, we define `mint_msg` message variable.

```rust
let mint_msg = Cw721ExecuteMsg::<Extension, Empty>::Mint(MintMsg::<Extension> {
        token_id: config.unused_token_id.to_string(),
        owner: sender,
        token_uri: config.token_uri.clone().into(),
        extension: config.extension.clone(),
});
```

`mint_msg` is used to mint NFT so it will be a message of type `Cw721ExecuteMsg::Mint`. `Cw721ExecuteMsg` is defined in `cw721_base`, it is a tuple struct with the inner struct is `MintMsg` (also defined in `cw721_base`). We define its fields (`token_id`, `owner`, `token_uri`, `extension`) like in the code above.

And finally, we again use the Rust enum pattern to define the `callback` message (callback message is the message sent by the contract after receiving an activation message).

```rust
match config.cw721_address.clone() {
        Some(cw721) => {
            let callback =
                Cw721Contract::<Empty, Empty>(cw721, PhantomData, PhantomData).call(mint_msg)?;
            config.unused_token_id += 1;
            CONFIG.save(deps.storage, &config)?;

            Ok(Response::new().add_message(callback))
        }
        None => Err(ContractError::Cw721NotLinked {}),
}
```

`callback` in here is a `CosmosMsg` message to trigger the mint function on the Cw721 contract that is link to our contract after instantiation. If the NFT is minted, its total number of NFTs will be increased by one, it is applied by updating `config.unused_token_id` and saving the `config` to storage.

If `cw721_address` is already specified in `config` (it means there is a cw721 contract linked to our contract), then we will use for `execute_receive` function a return line with Ok structure and `add_message(callback)`.  Otherwise, return `Cw721NotLinked` error.

Ok nice, in this chapter, we have defined the `execute` entry point for our contract. In the next chapter, we will define the last required entry point of a CosmWasm contract - `query`.
